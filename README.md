# Lightning Distance Calculator
Lightning distance calculator is a simple Android app that helps you calculate the distance of a lightning strike.
It works by taking into consideration the propogation speed difference between sound and light. The app helps you
time the duration between a lightning flash and the sound of thunder. The app uses this time difference to calculate
the approximate distance of the lighting strike from you. The app also shows a neat log of past stikes along with
timestamps and distances
